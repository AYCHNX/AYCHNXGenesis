bitconnect blockchain mining has two phases; a time limited Proof Of Work mining phase and then a Proof Of Stake mining phase until the full supply is mined. The original bitconnectX blockchain launched on GitHub in early 2018 and was mined by a few public Proof Of Work mining pools, notably ["BitconnectxPool"](https://twitter.com/BitconnectxPool "BitconnectxPool") and ["bccxCloud"](https://twitter.com/bccxCloud "bccxCloud").

However, the original bitconnectX blockchain from 2018 did not successfully transition from Proof Of Work to Proof Of Stake. The original bitconnectX blockchain froze at around block 28065, some 65 blocks into Proof Of Stake.

The [blockchain](https://chainz.cryptoid.info/bccx/#!crypto "Blockchain") was restarted with a Genesis block by the miners of BitconnectxPool, [(MinersHub.one on Discord)](https://discord.gg/xu2eQhw). The first block was on the 8th of July 2019 and it was given away around Discord. One month later in August 2019 the bitconnectX Genesis blockchain successfully transitioned from Proof Of Work mining to Proof Of Stake mining.

**Key Points**
- Very Little Information Is Actually Known About bitconnectX
- bitconnectX Genesis Is Not The Original 2018 bitconnectX Blockchain
- bitconnectX Genesis Is Not A bitconnectX Fork
- UTXO Based Proof Of Stake Mining
- UTXO's Are Chunks Of Coins Within A Wallet / Node
- UTXO's Greater Than 960 BCCX Are Required To Be A Proof Of Stake Miner
- UTXO's Must Be 1 Hour Old To Begin Mining
- The bitconnectX Software Is A Full Node
- You Solo Mine Your Own Blocks
- Only A Windows Wallet And A Mac Daemon Were Released By bitconnect(X)
- Managing BCCX UTXO's Requires More Effort Than A bitconnectCoin Node
- Competing For Blocks Keeps The Network Alive
- 90 Day Optional Time Lock
- The Wallet User Interface Was Not Finished By bitconnect(X)
- Block Rewards May Well Be Replaced With Miner Fee Mining Rewards *(see below)*

[<p align="center">Inflation</p>](https://chainz.cryptoid.info/bccx/#@inflation "Inflation")
Based on the publicly available blockchain ledger diagram and information, the total supply of bitconnectX increases by around 10% every 3 months. With the current participation, block reward rate and difficulty it can be suspected that bitconnectX has one more phase, post inflation. 

Post Inflation may well begin in around 4 years when the full supply is reached, after which the block rewards will be replaced by miner fee mining rewards and no new bitconnectX coins will **ever** be mined.
